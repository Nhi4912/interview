# Deployment Status Update

## Build Issues Fixed ✅

Successfully resolved the npm dependency mismatches and build failures that were preventing GitHub Actions deployment.

### Issues Resolved:

1. **Package Lock File Out of Sync**: The `package-lock.json` file was out of sync with `package.json`, causing `npm ci` to fail with numerous missing and invalid package errors.

2. **Material-UI Dependencies**: The project was importing `@mui/material` components that weren't in the dependencies, causing build failures.

3. **React Router Conflicts**: The project was using `react-router-dom` which conflicts with Next.js's built-in routing system.

### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Fixed Package Dependencies**:
   - Deleted outdated `package-lock.json`
   - Regenerated lock file with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
   - Verified `npm ci` works correctly

2. **Replaced Material-UI with Styled Components**:
   - Refactored all components to use `styled-components` instead of `@mui/material`
   - Updated: `KnowledgeCard.js`, `HomePage.js`, `CompleteGuide.js`, `InterviewChecklist.js`, `ProgressTracker.js`, `Footer.js`
   - Removed Material-UI dependency from `package.json`

3. **Fixed Navigation System**:
   - Replaced `react-router-dom` with Next.js `useRouter` hook
   - Updated navigation calls from `navigate()` to `router.push()`
   - Removed `react-router-dom` from dependencies

### Build Status:
- ✅ `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` - Working
- ✅ `npm run build` - Working
- ✅ All pages building successfully
- ✅ Static generation working
- ✅ Ready for GitHub Actions deployment

### Performance:
- All routes are statically generated
- Bundle sizes optimized
- No build errors or warnings (except deprecation warnings)

The project is now ready for successful deployment to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions.
