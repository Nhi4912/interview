# Problem: Drag and Drop List

## Description

Implement a draggable list where users can reorder items via drag-and-drop.

## Requirements

- Support mouse and keyboard drag-and-drop
- Update order in state
- Announce changes to screen readers
- Use ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Solution Outline

- Use HTML5 Drag and Drop API or a library (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd)
- Manage item order in state
- Announce reordering with ARIA live region

## Sample Implementation (React)

```jsx
// ...draggable list with keyboard and ARIA support...
```

## Follow-up

- How would you handle nested lists or tree structures?
- How would you animate item movement?
