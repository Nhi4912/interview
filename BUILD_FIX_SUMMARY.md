# Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` command was failing with multiple dependency sync issues between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. The project had conflicting architecture setups where both Next.js app router and React Router were being used simultaneously.

## Root Cause
1. **Outdated package-lock.json**: The lock file was out of sync with package.json, causing numerous missing and mismatched dependencies
2. **Conflicting architecture**: The project had both Next.js app router (`src/app/`) and React Router (`src/index.js`, `src/App.js`) setups
3. **MUI dependencies**: Old React Router components were using `@mui/material` which wasn't in package.json
4. **Module resolution conflicts**: Next.js was trying to resolve the old React Router files during build

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed outdated package-lock.json** and regenerated it with `npm install`
2. **Removed React Router setup** since Next.js app router was already properly configured:
   - Deleted `src/App.js`
   - Deleted `src/index.js`
   - Deleted `src/pages/` directory (old React Router pages)
   - Deleted MUI-dependent components
3. **Removed react-router-dom dependency** from package.json
4. **Kept Next.js app router structure** which was already properly using:
   - `styled-components` for styling
   - `src/app/` directory structure
   - TypeScript support
   - Proper Next.js configuration

## Build Results
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ All 8 static pages generated
- ✅ No module resolution errors
- ✅ No dependency conflicts
- ✅ Ready for GitHub Pages deployment

## Deployment Status
The changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub. The GitHub Actions workflow should now pass and successfully deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Next Steps
The project is now ready for deployment with a clean Next.js app router architecture using styled-components for styling.
