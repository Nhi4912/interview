# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive frontend interview preparation website. The website will serve as a personal learning platform to prepare for technical interviews at major tech companies like FAANG, Axon, and others. It will render and organize all AI-generated content from various directories (frontend, leetcode, theory-and-visuals, templates, etc.) in a structured, searchable, and visually appealing manner. The platform will support comprehensive learning paths from fundamentals to advanced topics, include behavioral questions with answers, and provide progress tracking capabilities.

5. WHEN a user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens without compromising content.

### Requirement 6: Behavioral Question Practice

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want access to behavioral questions with sample answers, so that I can prepare for non-technical aspects of interviews.

1. WHEN a user navigates to the behavioral section THEN the system SHALL display categorized behavioral questions.
2. WHEN a user selects a behavioral question THEN the system SHALL show sample answers and frameworks for structuring responses.
3. WHEN behavioral content includes company-specific patterns THEN the system SHALL organize them by company.
4. WHEN a user wants to practice THEN the system SHALL provide a self-assessment mechanism for behavioral questions.
5. WHEN viewing behavioral questions THEN the system SHALL link to related soft skills content when available.

### Requirement 7: Deployment and Accessibility

**User Story:** As the website owner, I want the site to be properly deployed to GitHub Pages with automated workflows, so that updates to content are automatically reflected on the live site.

3. WHEN a deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL verify all pages render correctly before finalizing.
4. WHEN the website is accessed THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
5. WHEN a deployment fails THEN the system SHALL notify the repository owner and maintain the previous working version.

### Requirement 8: Interactive Code Examples

**User Story:** As a developer studying algorithms, I want interactive code examples, so that I can understand implementation details better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a code example THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting appropriate to the language.
2. WHEN a code example is interactive THEN the system SHALL allow running the code in the browser when possible.
3. WHEN algorithm visualizations are available THEN the system SHALL render them to illustrate how the algorithm works.
