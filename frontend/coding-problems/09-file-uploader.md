# Problem: File Uploader

## Description

Build a file uploader component with drag-and-drop and progress indication.

## Requirements

- Support drag-and-drop and file input
- Show upload progress for each file
- Handle errors and retries
- Limit file size and type

## Solution Outline

- Use `input[type="file"]` and drag events
- Track upload state and progress

## Sample Implementation (React)

```jsx
// ...file uploader with drag events and progress bar...
```

## Follow-up

- How would you secure file uploads?
- How would you support large file uploads (chunking)?
